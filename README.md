# 👋 Hi, I'm Denney (HastieIO)

Welcome to my GitHub — a place where I share my journey in IT and cybersecurity, PC builds I've completed, and reflections from real-world experience.

Think of this like a **personal gallery** — where I document what I've worked on, why I did it, and what I learned along the way.

## 🔧 PC Builds (Mine & For Others)

I enjoy building PCs — both for myself and for friends, classmates, and clients. Every build is planned based on real needs like gaming, school, or work.

- **[PC builds](https://github.com/HastieIO/gaming-pc-builds)** — PC builds I have done over the last 2 years!

Each project includes:
- Full part list and price breakdown
- Photos of the build
- Why certain parts were chosen
- General Notes

## 🖥️ IT & Cybersecurity Projects

I'm currently studying cybersecurity and gaining hands-on experience through labs, self-study, and internships.

**Work In Progress/Coming Soon**

## ✍️ Writings & Internships

I like to reflect on what I’ve learned through work and projects. These are not tutorials — just my personal thoughts and takeaways.

  Occasional posts about studying, building, and working in tech.
