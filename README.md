# 👋 Hi, I'm Denney (HastieIO)

Welcome to my GitHub — a **personal gallery** where I document my journey through IT and cybersecurity, PC builds, homelab experiments, and reflections from real-world experience.

This isn’t a place for polished tutorials. It’s where I break things, fix them, learn, and occasionally rant about it.

## 🖥️ Cybersecurity Projects & Labs

I'm currently diving deep into cybersecurity — especially **identity & access management (IAM)**, **Active Directory**, and **cloud security**. My projects aim to simulate real-world environments and threats, based on actual breaches and security gaps I’ve studied.

### 🔓 [HollowRoot – Insider Threat Lab](https://github.com/HastieIO/HollowRoot)
A fictional fintech company, built from the ground up — and then breached from the inside.  
Includes 100-user AD deployment, bad practices, cloud misconfigs, and a rogue intern storyline.

### 🧱 [Zero to Zero.Five – Homelab Security](https://github.com/HastieIO/zero-to-zero-five)
Securing my first Proxmox homelab using real-world hardening techniques, ACLs, Tailscale, and more.  
Think: zero trust… under my desk.

## 🔧 PC Builds (Mine & For Others)

I build PCs for gaming, school, and work — for myself and others.  
Every build is custom and documented with care.

- **[PC Builds Repo](https://github.com/HastieIO/gaming-pc-builds)** — part lists, pricing, photos, and build logic for each setup.

## ✍️ Writings & Reflections

I like to write about what I learn — not as a teacher, but as a student thinking out loud. These posts are personal reflections on internships, labs, and life in tech.

- **[Tech Blog: Learning & Growth](https://github.com/HastieIO/writings)**  
  Thoughts on security, career, and building things that break.

## 🌐 Coming Soon
- Personal portfolio site (terminal-style landing page)
- Full write-up of *HollowRoot Phase 2* (cloud pivot + Azure exploitation)
- More red/blue team simulations and real-world inspired lab environments

Thanks for stopping by — and feel free to poke around.
