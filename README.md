# 👋 Hi, I'm Denney (HastieIO)

Welcome to my GitHub — a **personal gallery** where I document my journey through IT and cybersecurity, PC builds, homelab experiments, and reflections from real-world experience.

This isn’t a place for polished tutorials. It’s where I break things, fix them, learn, and occasionally rant about it.

## 🖥️ Cybersecurity Projects & Labs

I'm currently diving deep into cybersecurity — especially **identity & access management (IAM)**, **Active Directory**, and **cloud security**. My projects are based on real attack paths and mistakes seen in the wild.

### 🔓 [HollowRoot – Insider Threat Lab](https://github.com/HastieIO/HollowRoot-Insider-Threat-Lab-in-AD-Azure)  
A fictional fintech company, **Blackridge Bank**, built from scratch — and then breached by a rogue intern using weak passwords, overprivileged accounts, reused credentials, and cloud misconfigs.  
Includes a full 100-user AD deployment, NTFS abuse, a hybrid Azure setup, and a storyline inspired by real-world breaches like Uber and Capital One.

### 🧱 [Zero to Zero.Five – Proxmox Homelab](https://github.com/HastieIO/zero-to-zero-five-homelab)  
My first homelab — secured from the ground up.  
Built on Proxmox VE with hardened SSH, identity-based access via Tailscale, UFW firewall rules, 2FA for the GUI, and ACLs that mimic zero trust.  
Not enterprise gear, but still treated like production.

## 🔧 PC Builds (Mine & For Others)

I build PCs for gaming, school, and work — for myself and others.  
Every build is planned with care and documented with:

- Part lists & price breakdowns  
- Photos of the build  
- Notes on why parts were chosen  
- Lessons learned

## ✍️ Writings & Reflections

I like to write about what I learn — not as a tutorial, but as a personal debrief.  
Sometimes it's about a project, sometimes about work or life in tech.

- **[Tech Blog: Learning & Growth](https://github.com/HastieIO/writings)**  
  Thoughts on security, career, and building stuff that breaks.

## 🌐 Coming Soon

- Terminal-style personal portfolio (hosted here)  
- *HollowRoot Phase 2*: Azure exploitation, blob access, and logic bombs  
- More high-impact red/blue team labs  
- Blog-style reflections from my internships and cert journey
